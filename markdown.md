## Contributing Guidelines:
1. Each feature should have its own branch (`feature/feature-name`)
2. All security-related changes require code review
3. Update this roadmap when features are completed
4. Add tests for new functionality
5. Update documentation for API changes

---

## Notes:
- Rate limiting is essential before public launch
- Security features are non-negotiable and must be implemented first
- User feedback should drive priority adjustments
- Performance testing required before scaling features
